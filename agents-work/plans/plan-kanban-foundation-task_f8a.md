# Kanban Board Foundational Infrastructure Plan

## Component Overview
This plan establishes the core structure for the Kanban board app as per the task spec and design_spec.md (referenced for architecture: Flask backend, SQLite DB, basic frontend scaffold). Scope limited to initialization only - no API endpoints, UI logic, or extras.

## Granularity
Commit-level tasks: atomic changes with verification.

## Tasks Overview
1. Project structure + requirements.txt
2. Flask app + basic route
3. SQLite DB schema creation
4. Frontend scaffold (HTML/CSS/JS)
5. Verification tests

## Dependencies
Sequential: structure → backend → DB → frontend → test.

Follow design_spec.md strictly - no expansion.
